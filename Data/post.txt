NEEDED black suspenders please,
Q for peeps who will be arriving to NYUAD early next semester: RAs, MARHABA peeps, some of StuGov? I am thinking about pushing for RA's UAE visa being processed before/together with incoming freshman - thus get the passports back before Al-Hijra/ Islamic New Year (travel XD) and not dealing with it in the beginning of the semester. Between the 3 groups(RA, Marhaba,
StuGov) there is a ton of us and it seems even logistically easier for immigration office to finish us separately. Anybody has experience and knows who to contact? Opinion of the people it would influence - you want this? (or is this already happening and I missed it last year?),

I require you to vote? (Is that how this works?) https://studentvote.nyu.edu  Since you are already reading let me elaborate on why I think Tami is comparably better candidate for the President: -PRIOR EXPERIENCE WITH STUGOV - we are approaching a transitional period without Vic Lindsay and with new constitution. We need somebody who was involved in Abu Dhabi StuGov and can transition to the presidential position almost without any guidance. -she GETS STUFF DONE - she does no...t only start a project but also finishes it, be it working with ResEd or class events. -she is EASY TO REACH - answers her e-mails and can make time for you/your representation when necessary. She makes time to listen to your concerns and gives advice if she can. -she is SUPPORTING YOU, NOT IDEOLOGIES - it is the student voice that matters to her, not transnational concepts. -she is not gonna be buying your votes - I am doing this because I am scared of her not winning, not because she asked. Lets be real she will not do any kind of propaganda. PM me/comment any questions you might have - I can elaborate on any of the points and why I think them applicable ONLY to Tami. See More,(
resolved) FORMS OF WRITING FOR THE SCREEN I am reaching out to those enrolled in Forms of Writing for the Screen, especially those who are not film majors. Despite registering as soon as the enrollment was opened, I did not get a place on the Forms of Writing for the Screen course with Scandar, and am currently the second on the waitlist. ... Being a decided freshman Film (Practice) major, it is mandatory that I take the course in the fall, and it is the last requirement to fulfill to study away in sophomore spring. My courses have been planned towards that goal for the past two semesters, and are jeopardized because of a single course. It should also really be taken ASAP to do better in screenwriting for other film projects. Would someone please kindly drop the course to spare a lot of worries and e-mails? Either someone enrolled, or the first person on the waitlist. I understand that this may be a lot to ask, and that I am in no way more entitled to have the spot, but if you could just PM me to have a discussion about this, I would be tremendously grateful.  Please do respond to this, and thank you in advance. See More,

WON'T BE RESOLVED / CLOSED] Can we (Student Gov, students etc.) petition to be allowed to change our flights through the airline directly instead of going through Nirvana? Ideally, Nirvana should be completely removed from this process but I know it's highly unlikely to happen. Every year when I am trying to change my flight they provide me with a ridiculous quote. Often it is twice more expensive than if I simply do it directly through the airline. Always, booking a new direct flight on your own costs a lot cheaper than changing it with Nirvana due to their ridiculous fees. NYUAD Student Government,

ISTANBUL RECOMMENDATIONS FOR SPRING BREAK  Hey guys! since half of the school population is going to Istanbul for spring break and a lot of people asked me about what to do, I thought I‚Äôd just share this on ror. (I live in Istanbul). This is so long so I kinda just put it in categories. You can message me if you have any other questions! Also, because I‚Äôm a really food oriented person, these recommendations are quite food oriented.  Make sure you get an IstanbulKart as soon as you land in Istanbul. The public transportation system is really extensive and you can go anywhere with it. Don‚Äôt forget that Google Maps will tell you which public transportation to take!! The official public transportation works with IstanbulKart (metro, metrobus, ferry, motor, buses, etc). There are also privately owned public transportation systems, like dolmu≈ü, minibus, etc. These ones can be a bit tricky to use as tourists (no official payment system/the driver 98% won‚Äôt speak English/no official stops, you just say can i get off here, etc). But the official public transportation should get you anywhere, anyways.  Istanbul basically doesn‚Äôt have wifi anywhere except some restaurants. Don‚Äôt be surprised!  If you haven‚Äôt checked yet, Turkish lira and dirham almost have the same exchange rate. So when I‚Äôm saying 120 lira, I mean like 120 dhs.  Also, I‚Äôm not gonna mention any obvious, touristy places, like the Maiden‚Äôs Tower, Hagia Sophia, Topkapƒ± Palace, etc.  √úsk√ºdar: Kuzguncuk, Meter D√∂ner, Pa≈üalimanƒ± Kafe, Fethipa≈üa Korusu, kebab  This is the Asian side, you can cross over with a ferry for couple liras. When you come to √úskudar (you‚Äôll be by the sea), just walk towards Kuzguncuk. This should be about 1, max 2 km. Kuzguncuk is super cute, reminds me of Notting Hill in London. Should have couple shops as well. For food, go to METET D√∂ner. Order d√∂ner, my favourite is pilav √ºst√º d√∂ner (this is basically meat on top of fried rice). This restaurant is quite cheap, especially according to Dhabi standards but SO delicious. When you‚Äôre walking back to central √úsk√ºdar, you should cross by Beltur Pa≈üalimani Kafe, it‚Äôs around 500 metres from Kuzguncuk. This place is run by the municipality, so it‚Äôs also relatively cheap. But the location is AMAZING. You will literally be sitting on the sea with a full fledged view of the Bosphorus. Order Turkish tea if you don‚Äôt feel like anything else. When you leave Pa≈üalimanƒ± Kafe, keep walking on the coastline and you should see the entrance to Fethipa≈üa Korusu. This is a tiny park/forest. Walk up the park and you will have an amazing view of the Bosphorus from above.  Another of my favourite places in √úsk√ºdar is this tiny kebab shop called Urfalƒ± Kasƒ±m Usta. They have the best kebab in Istanbul imo. Get Adana kebab if you like spicy food, Urfa kebab if you don‚Äôt. They‚Äôll bring it to you with your kebab, but if they don‚Äôt, ask for ezme. My fav food that no one can replicate. It‚Äôs a type of tomato/chili sauce but it‚Äôs so good. Also, if they still have it (they run out really fast), get some liver. I don‚Äôt eat it but people love it. They cut it into pieces and fry/cook it with butter. Also get ayran, the Turkish yoghurt drink. Don‚Äôt be surprised if no one speaks English, this is the least touristy place!  Kadƒ±k√∂y: Ko√ßo, rakƒ± balƒ±k, ice cream, bars My fav place in Istanbul. Again, on the Asian side and reachable by the ferry. This is a more  hipster, young area of Istanbul and it will be incredibly crowded. What you should do in Kadƒ±k√∂y is basically walk around and explore. Start walking from the street between Starbucks and Coldstone ice cream. This location description may sound weird but it‚Äôs really obvious what I mean when you‚Äôre there. You will see lots of cool shops. Go to Kadƒ±k√∂y around 5 pm, walk around a bit, eat, and go drinking. For food, go to Ko√ßo Meyhanesi. This restaurant is technically in Moda, a neighbourhood in Kadƒ±k√∂y that will take you 20 mins of walking to get to from the ferry. This place serves rakƒ± balƒ±k, which means meze (Turkish tapas), seafood and Turkish alcohol. THIS PLACE MAKES SUCH GOOD FOOD. It‚Äôs also quite expensive. I would say 130-180 liras per person depending on how much you drink. But that also means it‚Äôs just a bit more expensive than any restaurant in Abu Dhabi. I think it‚Äôs worth the money. Once you‚Äôre seated, they‚Äôll bring out a huge tray with all the tapas they have. You can choose whatever looks food. Here are my recommendations though. For cold starters: Haydari (yoghurt), Fava (bean puree? idk), Octopus salad, Hamsi (anchovy ancues), midye dolma (stuffed mussels, order one per person), lakerda (salt cured fish). For hot starters: kalamar tava (calamari), karides g√ºve√ß (shrimp casserole), tereyaƒüƒ±nda karides (shrimp fried in butter), midye tava (fried mussels). Then order Rakƒ±, 35 cl should be enough for 5-7 people. Keep in mind that two fingers of rakƒ± are mixed with a lot of water and ice. Just because you think you drink well don‚Äôt think you can drink a lot of rakƒ±!! Also, what we usually do is just order a lot of mezes, which is the stuff I listed above, and share. You can also get proper fish if you want but I don‚Äôt find it necessary after all the amazing tapas. For dessert, you can stop by Ali Usta Dondurmacƒ±sƒ±. This is a super famous ice cream shop. 5 liras per scoop, super good ice cream. Alternatively, go to Abbas waffles next door and get waffles.  After food, go to Ayƒ± Bar. This is my fav bar in Istanbul and it‚Äôs usually quite crowded. If you cant find a place, go to Fil next door. Alcohol in Istanbul is usually 15-20 lira for beer, 30-50 for cocktails and hard liquor (per glass). Karak√∂y: BAKLAVA, (hipster) shopping, developing film, Galata Tower, alcohol  Now we are in the European side. Another of my favourite neighbourhoods. In Karak√∂y, YOU HAVE TO GO TO KARAK√ñY G√úLL√úOƒûLU. This is a must to get the BEST BAKLAVA in the world. I‚Äôm not kidding. My favourite one is kaymaklƒ± baklava, which means baklava with cream(?). It‚Äôs the kind that doesn‚Äôt have nuts in it. But baklava with pistachios or walnuts is also so good. Trust me on this. Go to G√ºll√ºoƒülu to have Baklava!!!  Great place for hipster shops. Just walk around and explore.  Also, if you need to develop film, there is a Fujifilm in Karak√∂y really close to G√ºll√ºoƒülu.  Apart from very important baklava, the best thing you can do to explore Karak√∂y is walk around the neighbourhood. Karak√∂y isn‚Äôt isolated, it connects to other cool neighbourhoods like Galata and Be≈üikta≈ü. You can walk to the Galata Tower from Karak√∂y. Especially at night, the neighbourhood around Galata Tower is really cool, you can also drink a lot.  Ortak√∂y: the House Cafe, shopping, shisha, kumpir  Ortak√∂y is another neighbourhood to walk around in but it isn‚Äôt hipstery like Karak√∂y or Kadƒ±k√∂y. One of my favourite restaurants in Istanbul is in Ortak√∂y, called the House Cafe. It‚Äôs a bit bougie, the food isn‚Äôt super good, and it isn‚Äôt Turkish food (just normal food lmao), but the atmosphere is AMAZING. There literally isn‚Äôt a barrier between the restaurant and the sea. So much so that some rich ass people come straight into the restaurant with their yachts lol. The restaurant isn‚Äôt so expensive though, 50-60 liras per meal, or even less.  If you don‚Äôt wanna take the bougie route, just go to one of the kumpir shops by the huge ass mosque (the Ortak√∂y mosque). Kumpir is jacket potato with lots of toppings. Use to cost like 5 liras but now it costs around 20.  Ortak√∂y has a lot of tiny shops for souvenirs and jewellery. Make sure you‚Äôre not getting ripped off, though! You shouldn‚Äôt pay more than 40 liras for anything.  Ortak√∂y is also a good place to have some shisha. Turkish shisha is a bit different than Arabic shisha I guess, but not so different. Fatih: pide  Another of my favourite restaurants is in Fatih. Fatih isn‚Äôt the most aesthetic neighbourhood but it has the BEST pide shop. Pide is like Turkish pizza(?). It‚Äôs basically dough with toppings that they bake in a huge ass oven. The restaurant is called Fatih Pide Salonu. Also not a touristic place. Get pide with ka≈üar cheese, with mince meat, and with beef bacon!! Also get ayran.  Pm me if you have any other questions!,

Hey! We‚Äôre starting a new SIG called PayWrite: Publish Your Work which hopes to become a publishing hub and network for our student community. We noticed there is a lot of content (e.g. papers, art for classes) produced at NYUAD which goes shut into the drawer or stays on a computer disk indefinitely with no purpose after the semester ends.  We aim at finding the audience for such quality work that would otherwise be paid little heed here. Members of our SIG would get access to academic journals, newspapers and other leading publishing websites with our help through our network of affiliates. By participating you risk nothing but gaining audience and associated benefits. Comment you netID under this post if you are interested üòâ,

Hey everyone! My family found this Persian kitten on the streets, beaten up and dirty. After a visit to the vet and a wash, she's been with us. She is super cuddy and playful, and has a lot of love to share! Unfortunately, she has been diagnosed with Chorona. This is a disease transmitted through saliva and feces to other cats (humans are not affected!) This means she will have to stay away from other cats and animals to ensure others don't get infected. At home, we already have 5 others cats, and so we cannot keep her for long. We want to find for her a new home. Please spread the message and tag people who may be interested or could help. Thank you! Please message me if you have any questions!,

If you're a freshman taking data structures/algorithms this semester this is a message for you!!! As you may know, the CS department is basically forcing our study away to be on Junior fall, and at the moment, the operating systems class is only offered on the fall semesters. OS is a prerequisite to other classes including networks (required) and electives (computer security and I think databases, and you must take at least one CS elective in AD). This means that as of now, you would have to waste one of your classes in New York by taking OS, or be unable to take some of the electives if you opt to take it Senior fall. I talked to Godfried today and put this on his radar, and he agrees it is a waste, so if enough people are willing to take the class Sophomore Spring the CS department will consider offering the class. (By the way, you will be fresh with CSO concepts that are used for the class!) If you are interested, please comment/PM so this can move forward!,

Hi, did this mess up anyone else's schedule?,
I'm doing research at a climate modeling lab at NYUAD. The lab would like to work with students interested in climate and environmental science. We're mainly trying to create interest among students and there aren't particular objectives set beforehand so the research will be flexible. The work may involve exploring data on a particular climate change phenomenon, for instance. And if the student wants to explore their own climate change problem (understanding glacier melting in antarctica or exploring the El-Nino etc), they can work on that topic with a lot of autonomy. There will most likely be statistics and data analysis in the work. But someone with basic programming experience (file handling etc) and a good background in science and math can fit the role. This may start as a summer internship and the student may end up continuing work with the lab for capstone and beyond. Climate studies is a scientifically rich subject and what these models can do is pretty crazy. I'd think many students will like this. Please let me know if you're interested.,

STUDENT GOVT POST] A huge thank you to everyone who was able to make it to the General Assembly last night! Based on the discussion we had yesterday about the End of Year Event (which will take place on April 20th), we have narrowed down the ideas to three: 1. Gala/Dance: You know how it goes. Dress to impress and dance the night away! And if you're not into dancing, don't worry - we'll have LOTS of food and dessert to keep you occupied for the night! 2. Lounge party: Be prepared for a chill night - look nice, but fancy dresses, heels, and tuxes are NOT necessary. Sip on some mocktails and eat appetizers and other finger foods as you lounge around (possibly a pool). 3. Lounge/Gala combination: Dress for a gala or dress to lounge - it's all up to you! Dance to some good music, lounge around, both, or neither (and just go straight for the food). Give us your feedback on what you want by reacting to this post! For option #1, react with "love" <3 For option #2, react with "haha"  and for option #3, react with "wow" :O **Please react by THURSDAY MIDNIGHT (by Feb 16, 2017 at 11:59 pm)** Also leave any comments or suggestions you may have in the comments section below, and/or email me at ao1402@nyu.edu. Looking forward to an amazing end of year event! ****Edit: there has been an update in option #2.,

I require you to vote? (Is that how this works?) https://studentvote.nyu.edu  Since you are already reading let me elaborate on why I think Tami is comparably better candidate for the President: -PRIOR EXPERIENCE WITH STUGOV - we are approaching a transitional period without Vic Lindsay and with new constitution. We need somebody who was involved in Abu Dhabi StuGov and can transition to the presidential position almost without any guidance. -she GETS STUFF DONE - she does no...t only start a project but also finishes it, be it working with ResEd or class events. -she is EASY TO REACH - answers her e-mails and can make time for you/your representation when necessary. She makes time to listen to your concerns and gives advice if she can. -she is SUPPORTING YOU, NOT IDEOLOGIES - it is the student voice that matters to her, not transnational concepts. -she is not gonna be buying your votes - I am doing this because I am scared of her not winning, not because she asked. Lets be real she will not do any kind of propaganda. PM me/comment any questions you might have - I can elaborate on any of the points and why I think them applicable ONLY to Tami. See More,(
resolved) FORMS OF WRITING FOR THE SCREEN I am reaching out to those enrolled in Forms of Writing for the Screen, especially those who are not film majors. Despite registering as soon as the enrollment was opened, I did not get a place on the Forms of Writing for the Screen course with Scandar, and am currently the second on the waitlist. ... Being a decided freshman Film (Practice) major, it is mandatory that I take the course in the fall, and it is the last requirement to fulfill to study away in sophomore spring. My courses have been planned towards that goal for the past two semesters, and are jeopardized because of a single course. It should also really be taken ASAP to do better in screenwriting for other film projects. Would someone please kindly drop the course to spare a lot of worries and e-mails? Either someone enrolled, or the first person on the waitlist. I understand that this may be a lot to ask, and that I am in no way more entitled to have the spot, but if you could just PM me to have a discussion about this, I would be tremendously grateful.  Please do respond to this, and thank you in advance. See More,

WON'T BE RESOLVED / CLOSED] Can we (Student Gov, students etc.) petition to be allowed to change our flights through the airline directly instead of going through Nirvana? Ideally, Nirvana should be completely removed from this process but I know it's highly unlikely to happen. Every year when I am trying to change my flight they provide me with a ridiculous quote. Often it is twice more expensive than if I simply do it directly through the airline. Always, booking a new direct flight on your own costs a lot cheaper than changing it with Nirvana due to their ridiculous fees. NYUAD Student Government,

ISTANBUL RECOMMENDATIONS FOR SPRING BREAK  Hey guys! since half of the school population is going to Istanbul for spring break and a lot of people asked me about what to do, I thought I‚Äôd just share this on ror. (I live in Istanbul). This is so long so I kinda just put it in categories. You can message me if you have any other questions! Also, because I‚Äôm a really food oriented person, these recommendations are quite food oriented.  Make sure you get an IstanbulKart as soon as you land in Istanbul. The public transportation system is really extensive and you can go anywhere with it. Don‚Äôt forget that Google Maps will tell you which public transportation to take!! The official public transportation works with IstanbulKart (metro, metrobus, ferry, motor, buses, etc). There are also privately owned public transportation systems, like dolmu≈ü, minibus, etc. These ones can be a bit tricky to use as tourists (no official payment system/the driver 98% won‚Äôt speak English/no official stops, you just say can i get off here, etc). But the official public transportation should get you anywhere, anyways.  Istanbul basically doesn‚Äôt have wifi anywhere except some restaurants. Don‚Äôt be surprised!  If you haven‚Äôt checked yet, Turkish lira and dirham almost have the same exchange rate. So when I‚Äôm saying 120 lira, I mean like 120 dhs.  Also, I‚Äôm not gonna mention any obvious, touristy places, like the Maiden‚Äôs Tower, Hagia Sophia, Topkapƒ± Palace, etc.  √úsk√ºdar: Kuzguncuk, Meter D√∂ner, Pa≈üalimanƒ± Kafe, Fethipa≈üa Korusu, kebab  This is the Asian side, you can cross over with a ferry for couple liras. When you come to √úskudar (you‚Äôll be by the sea), just walk towards Kuzguncuk. This should be about 1, max 2 km. Kuzguncuk is super cute, reminds me of Notting Hill in London. Should have couple shops as well. For food, go to METET D√∂ner. Order d√∂ner, my favourite is pilav √ºst√º d√∂ner (this is basically meat on top of fried rice). This restaurant is quite cheap, especially according to Dhabi standards but SO delicious. When you‚Äôre walking back to central √úsk√ºdar, you should cross by Beltur Pa≈üalimani Kafe, it‚Äôs around 500 metres from Kuzguncuk. This place is run by the municipality, so it‚Äôs also relatively cheap. But the location is AMAZING. You will literally be sitting on the sea with a full fledged view of the Bosphorus. Order Turkish tea if you don‚Äôt feel like anything else. When you leave Pa≈üalimanƒ± Kafe, keep walking on the coastline and you should see the entrance to Fethipa≈üa Korusu. This is a tiny park/forest. Walk up the park and you will have an amazing view of the Bosphorus from above.  Another of my favourite places in √úsk√ºdar is this tiny kebab shop called Urfalƒ± Kasƒ±m Usta. They have the best kebab in Istanbul imo. Get Adana kebab if you like spicy food, Urfa kebab if you don‚Äôt. They‚Äôll bring it to you with your kebab, but if they don‚Äôt, ask for ezme. My fav food that no one can replicate. It‚Äôs a type of tomato/chili sauce but it‚Äôs so good. Also, if they still have it (they run out really fast), get some liver. I don‚Äôt eat it but people love it. They cut it into pieces and fry/cook it with butter. Also get ayran, the Turkish yoghurt drink. Don‚Äôt be surprised if no one speaks English, this is the least touristy place!  Kadƒ±k√∂y: Ko√ßo, rakƒ± balƒ±k, ice cream, bars My fav place in Istanbul. Again, on the Asian side and reachable by the ferry. This is a more  hipster, young area of Istanbul and it will be incredibly crowded. What you should do in Kadƒ±k√∂y is basically walk around and explore. Start walking from the street between Starbucks and Coldstone ice cream. This location description may sound weird but it‚Äôs really obvious what I mean when you‚Äôre there. You will see lots of cool shops. Go to Kadƒ±k√∂y around 5 pm, walk around a bit, eat, and go drinking. For food, go to Ko√ßo Meyhanesi. This restaurant is technically in Moda, a neighbourhood in Kadƒ±k√∂y that will take you 20 mins of walking to get to from the ferry. This place serves rakƒ± balƒ±k, which means meze (Turkish tapas), seafood and Turkish alcohol. THIS PLACE MAKES SUCH GOOD FOOD. It‚Äôs also quite expensive. I would say 130-180 liras per person depending on how much you drink. But that also means it‚Äôs just a bit more expensive than any restaurant in Abu Dhabi. I think it‚Äôs worth the money. Once you‚Äôre seated, they‚Äôll bring out a huge tray with all the tapas they have. You can choose whatever looks food. Here are my recommendations though. For cold starters: Haydari (yoghurt), Fava (bean puree? idk), Octopus salad, Hamsi (anchovy ancues), midye dolma (stuffed mussels, order one per person), lakerda (salt cured fish). For hot starters: kalamar tava (calamari), karides g√ºve√ß (shrimp casserole), tereyaƒüƒ±nda karides (shrimp fried in butter), midye tava (fried mussels). Then order Rakƒ±, 35 cl should be enough for 5-7 people. Keep in mind that two fingers of rakƒ± are mixed with a lot of water and ice. Just because you think you drink well don‚Äôt think you can drink a lot of rakƒ±!! Also, what we usually do is just order a lot of mezes, which is the stuff I listed above, and share. You can also get proper fish if you want but I don‚Äôt find it necessary after all the amazing tapas. For dessert, you can stop by Ali Usta Dondurmacƒ±sƒ±. This is a super famous ice cream shop. 5 liras per scoop, super good ice cream. Alternatively, go to Abbas waffles next door and get waffles.  After food, go to Ayƒ± Bar. This is my fav bar in Istanbul and it‚Äôs usually quite crowded. If you cant find a place, go to Fil next door. Alcohol in Istanbul is usually 15-20 lira for beer, 30-50 for cocktails and hard liquor (per glass). Karak√∂y: BAKLAVA, (hipster) shopping, developing film, Galata Tower, alcohol  Now we are in the European side. Another of my favourite neighbourhoods. In Karak√∂y, YOU HAVE TO GO TO KARAK√ñY G√úLL√úOƒûLU. This is a must to get the BEST BAKLAVA in the world. I‚Äôm not kidding. My favourite one is kaymaklƒ± baklava, which means baklava with cream(?). It‚Äôs the kind that doesn‚Äôt have nuts in it. But baklava with pistachios or walnuts is also so good. Trust me on this. Go to G√ºll√ºoƒülu to have Baklava!!!  Great place for hipster shops. Just walk around and explore.  Also, if you need to develop film, there is a Fujifilm in Karak√∂y really close to G√ºll√ºoƒülu.  Apart from very important baklava, the best thing you can do to explore Karak√∂y is walk around the neighbourhood. Karak√∂y isn‚Äôt isolated, it connects to other cool neighbourhoods like Galata and Be≈üikta≈ü. You can walk to the Galata Tower from Karak√∂y. Especially at night, the neighbourhood around Galata Tower is really cool, you can also drink a lot.  Ortak√∂y: the House Cafe, shopping, shisha, kumpir  Ortak√∂y is another neighbourhood to walk around in but it isn‚Äôt hipstery like Karak√∂y or Kadƒ±k√∂y. One of my favourite restaurants in Istanbul is in Ortak√∂y, called the House Cafe. It‚Äôs a bit bougie, the food isn‚Äôt super good, and it isn‚Äôt Turkish food (just normal food lmao), but the atmosphere is AMAZING. There literally isn‚Äôt a barrier between the restaurant and the sea. So much so that some rich ass people come straight into the restaurant with their yachts lol. The restaurant isn‚Äôt so expensive though, 50-60 liras per meal, or even less.  If you don‚Äôt wanna take the bougie route, just go to one of the kumpir shops by the huge ass mosque (the Ortak√∂y mosque). Kumpir is jacket potato with lots of toppings. Use to cost like 5 liras but now it costs around 20.  Ortak√∂y has a lot of tiny shops for souvenirs and jewellery. Make sure you‚Äôre not getting ripped off, though! You shouldn‚Äôt pay more than 40 liras for anything.  Ortak√∂y is also a good place to have some shisha. Turkish shisha is a bit different than Arabic shisha I guess, but not so different. Fatih: pide  Another of my favourite restaurants is in Fatih. Fatih isn‚Äôt the most aesthetic neighbourhood but it has the BEST pide shop. Pide is like Turkish pizza(?). It‚Äôs basically dough with toppings that they bake in a huge ass oven. The restaurant is called Fatih Pide Salonu. Also not a touristic place. Get pide with ka≈üar cheese, with mince meat, and with beef bacon!! Also get ayran.  Pm me if you have any other questions!,

Hey! We‚Äôre starting a new SIG called PayWrite: Publish Your Work which hopes to become a publishing hub and network for our student community. We noticed there is a lot of content (e.g. papers, art for classes) produced at NYUAD which goes shut into the drawer or stays on a computer disk indefinitely with no purpose after the semester ends.  We aim at finding the audience for such quality work that would otherwise be paid little heed here. Members of our SIG would get access to academic journals, newspapers and other leading publishing websites with our help through our network of affiliates. By participating you risk nothing but gaining audience and associated benefits. Comment you netID under this post if you are interested üòâ,

If you're a freshman taking data structures/algorithms this semester this is a message for you!!! As you may know, the CS department is basically forcing our study away to be on Junior fall, and at the moment, the operating systems class is only offered on the fall semesters. OS is a prerequisite to other classes including networks (required) and electives (computer security and I think databases, and you must take at least one CS elective in AD). This means that as of now, you would have to waste one of your classes in New York by taking OS, or be unable to take some of the electives if you opt to take it Senior fall. I talked to Godfried today and put this on his radar, and he agrees it is a waste, so if enough people are willing to take the class Sophomore Spring the CS department will consider offering the class. (By the way, you will be fresh with CSO concepts that are used for the class!) If you are interested, please comment/PM so this can move forward!,

Hi, did this mess up anyone else's schedule?,
I'm doing research at a climate modeling lab at NYUAD. The lab would like to work with students interested in climate and environmental science. We're mainly trying to create interest among students and there aren't particular objectives set beforehand so the research will be flexible. The work may involve exploring data on a particular climate change phenomenon, for instance. And if the student wants to explore their own climate change problem (understanding glacier melting in antarctica or exploring the El-Nino etc), they can work on that topic with a lot of autonomy. There will most likely be statistics and data analysis in the work. But someone with basic programming experience (file handling etc) and a good background in science and math can fit the role. This may start as a summer internship and the student may end up continuing work with the lab for capstone and beyond. Climate studies is a scientifically rich subject and what these models can do is pretty crazy. I'd think many students will like this. Please let me know if you're interested.,

STUDENT GOVT POST] A huge thank you to everyone who was able to make it to the General Assembly last night! Based on the discussion we had yesterday about the End of Year Event (which will take place on April 20th), we have narrowed down the ideas to three: 1. Gala/Dance: You know how it goes. Dress to impress and dance the night away! And if you're not into dancing, don't worry - we'll have LOTS of food and dessert to keep you occupied for the night! 2. Lounge party: Be prepared for a chill night - look nice, but fancy dresses, heels, and tuxes are NOT necessary. Sip on some mocktails and eat appetizers and other finger foods as you lounge around (possibly a pool). 3. Lounge/Gala combination: Dress for a gala or dress to lounge - it's all up to you! Dance to some good music, lounge around, both, or neither (and just go straight for the food). Give us your feedback on what you want by reacting to this post! For option #1, react with "love" <3 For option #2, react with "haha"  and for option #3, react with "wow" :O **Please react by THURSDAY MIDNIGHT (by Feb 16, 2017 at 11:59 pm)** Also leave any comments or suggestions you may have in the comments section below, and/or email me at ao1402@nyu.edu. Looking forward to an amazing end of year event! ****Edit: there has been an update in option #2.,

Etihad Flight Pricing] Hi, does anyone know anything about (etihad specifically?) flight pricing? Flights from tomorrow to two weeks out are 66% the price of flights outside that time window.

I require you to vote? (Is that how this works?) https://studentvote.nyu.edu  Since you are already reading let me elaborate on why I think Tami is comparably better candidate for the President: -PRIOR EXPERIENCE WITH STUGOV - we are approaching a transitional period without Vic Lindsay and with new constitution. We need somebody who was involved in Abu Dhabi StuGov and can transition to the presidential position almost without any guidance. -she GETS STUFF DONE - she does no...t only start a project but also finishes it, be it working with ResEd or class events. -she is EASY TO REACH - answers her e-mails and can make time for you/your representation when necessary. She makes time to listen to your concerns and gives advice if she can. -she is SUPPORTING YOU, NOT IDEOLOGIES - it is the student voice that matters to her, not transnational concepts. -she is not gonna be buying your votes - I am doing this because I am scared of her not winning, not because she asked. Lets be real she will not do any kind of propaganda. PM me/comment any questions you might have - I can elaborate on any of the points and why I think them applicable ONLY to Tami. See More,(
resolved) FORMS OF WRITING FOR THE SCREEN I am reaching out to those enrolled in Forms of Writing for the Screen, especially those who are not film majors. Despite registering as soon as the enrollment was opened, I did not get a place on the Forms of Writing for the Screen course with Scandar, and am currently the second on the waitlist. ... Being a decided freshman Film (Practice) major, it is mandatory that I take the course in the fall, and it is the last requirement to fulfill to study away in sophomore spring. My courses have been planned towards that goal for the past two semesters, and are jeopardized because of a single course. It should also really be taken ASAP to do better in screenwriting for other film projects. Would someone please kindly drop the course to spare a lot of worries and e-mails? Either someone enrolled, or the first person on the waitlist. I understand that this may be a lot to ask, and that I am in no way more entitled to have the spot, but if you could just PM me to have a discussion about this, I would be tremendously grateful.  Please do respond to this, and thank you in advance. See More,

Any Japanese speakers who would be willing to do live translation on calls? Basically I would ask a question in English, you would need to translate to Japanese and then translate the response back to English. It will be 3-4 hours worth of calls for which we would pay USD 100 in total.  The calls would be spread over 3-4 days so you will not need to work for more than 1-2 hours every day - just have a flexible schedule as the calls will be quite last  minute.

WON'T BE RESOLVED / CLOSED] Can we (Student Gov, students etc.) petition to be allowed to change our flights through the airline directly instead of going through Nirvana? Ideally, Nirvana should be completely removed from this process but I know it's highly unlikely to happen. Every year when I am trying to change my flight they provide me with a ridiculous quote. Often it is twice more expensive than if I simply do it directly through the airline. Always, booking a new direct flight on your own costs a lot cheaper than changing it with Nirvana due to their ridiculous fees. NYUAD Student Government,

ISTANBUL RECOMMENDATIONS FOR SPRING BREAK  Hey guys! since half of the school population is going to Istanbul for spring break and a lot of people asked me about what to do, I thought I‚Äôd just share this on ror. (I live in Istanbul). This is so long so I kinda just put it in categories. You can message me if you have any other questions! Also, because I‚Äôm a really food oriented person, these recommendations are quite food oriented.  Make sure you get an IstanbulKart as soon as you land in Istanbul. The public transportation system is really extensive and you can go anywhere with it. Don‚Äôt forget that Google Maps will tell you which public transportation to take!! The official public transportation works with IstanbulKart (metro, metrobus, ferry, motor, buses, etc). There are also privately owned public transportation systems, like dolmu≈ü, minibus, etc. These ones can be a bit tricky to use as tourists (no official payment system/the driver 98% won‚Äôt speak English/no official stops, you just say can i get off here, etc). But the official public transportation should get you anywhere, anyways.  Istanbul basically doesn‚Äôt have wifi anywhere except some restaurants. Don‚Äôt be surprised!  If you haven‚Äôt checked yet, Turkish lira and dirham almost have the same exchange rate. So when I‚Äôm saying 120 lira, I mean like 120 dhs.  Also, I‚Äôm not gonna mention any obvious, touristy places, like the Maiden‚Äôs Tower, Hagia Sophia, Topkapƒ± Palace, etc.  √úsk√ºdar: Kuzguncuk, Meter D√∂ner, Pa≈üalimanƒ± Kafe, Fethipa≈üa Korusu, kebab  This is the Asian side, you can cross over with a ferry for couple liras. When you come to √úskudar (you‚Äôll be by the sea), just walk towards Kuzguncuk. This should be about 1, max 2 km. Kuzguncuk is super cute, reminds me of Notting Hill in London. Should have couple shops as well. For food, go to METET D√∂ner. Order d√∂ner, my favourite is pilav √ºst√º d√∂ner (this is basically meat on top of fried rice). This restaurant is quite cheap, especially according to Dhabi standards but SO delicious. When you‚Äôre walking back to central √úsk√ºdar, you should cross by Beltur Pa≈üalimani Kafe, it‚Äôs around 500 metres from Kuzguncuk. This place is run by the municipality, so it‚Äôs also relatively cheap. But the location is AMAZING. You will literally be sitting on the sea with a full fledged view of the Bosphorus. Order Turkish tea if you don‚Äôt feel like anything else. When you leave Pa≈üalimanƒ± Kafe, keep walking on the coastline and you should see the entrance to Fethipa≈üa Korusu. This is a tiny park/forest. Walk up the park and you will have an amazing view of the Bosphorus from above.  Another of my favourite places in √úsk√ºdar is this tiny kebab shop called Urfalƒ± Kasƒ±m Usta. They have the best kebab in Istanbul imo. Get Adana kebab if you like spicy food, Urfa kebab if you don‚Äôt. They‚Äôll bring it to you with your kebab, but if they don‚Äôt, ask for ezme. My fav food that no one can replicate. It‚Äôs a type of tomato/chili sauce but it‚Äôs so good. Also, if they still have it (they run out really fast), get some liver. I don‚Äôt eat it but people love it. They cut it into pieces and fry/cook it with butter. Also get ayran, the Turkish yoghurt drink. Don‚Äôt be surprised if no one speaks English, this is the least touristy place!  Kadƒ±k√∂y: Ko√ßo, rakƒ± balƒ±k, ice cream, bars My fav place in Istanbul. Again, on the Asian side and reachable by the ferry. This is a more  hipster, young area of Istanbul and it will be incredibly crowded. What you should do in Kadƒ±k√∂y is basically walk around and explore. Start walking from the street between Starbucks and Coldstone ice cream. This location description may sound weird but it‚Äôs really obvious what I mean when you‚Äôre there. You will see lots of cool shops. Go to Kadƒ±k√∂y around 5 pm, walk around a bit, eat, and go drinking. For food, go to Ko√ßo Meyhanesi. This restaurant is technically in Moda, a neighbourhood in Kadƒ±k√∂y that will take you 20 mins of walking to get to from the ferry. This place serves rakƒ± balƒ±k, which means meze (Turkish tapas), seafood and Turkish alcohol. THIS PLACE MAKES SUCH GOOD FOOD. It‚Äôs also quite expensive. I would say 130-180 liras per person depending on how much you drink. But that also means it‚Äôs just a bit more expensive than any restaurant in Abu Dhabi. I think it‚Äôs worth the money. Once you‚Äôre seated, they‚Äôll bring out a huge tray with all the tapas they have. You can choose whatever looks food. Here are my recommendations though. For cold starters: Haydari (yoghurt), Fava (bean puree? idk), Octopus salad, Hamsi (anchovy ancues), midye dolma (stuffed mussels, order one per person), lakerda (salt cured fish). For hot starters: kalamar tava (calamari), karides g√ºve√ß (shrimp casserole), tereyaƒüƒ±nda karides (shrimp fried in butter), midye tava (fried mussels). Then order Rakƒ±, 35 cl should be enough for 5-7 people. Keep in mind that two fingers of rakƒ± are mixed with a lot of water and ice. Just because you think you drink well don‚Äôt think you can drink a lot of rakƒ±!! Also, what we usually do is just order a lot of mezes, which is the stuff I listed above, and share. You can also get proper fish if you want but I don‚Äôt find it necessary after all the amazing tapas. For dessert, you can stop by Ali Usta Dondurmacƒ±sƒ±. This is a super famous ice cream shop. 5 liras per scoop, super good ice cream. Alternatively, go to Abbas waffles next door and get waffles.  After food, go to Ayƒ± Bar. This is my fav bar in Istanbul and it‚Äôs usually quite crowded. If you cant find a place, go to Fil next door. Alcohol in Istanbul is usually 15-20 lira for beer, 30-50 for cocktails and hard liquor (per glass). Karak√∂y: BAKLAVA, (hipster) shopping, developing film, Galata Tower, alcohol  Now we are in the European side. Another of my favourite neighbourhoods. In Karak√∂y, YOU HAVE TO GO TO KARAK√ñY G√úLL√úOƒûLU. This is a must to get the BEST BAKLAVA in the world. I‚Äôm not kidding. My favourite one is kaymaklƒ± baklava, which means baklava with cream(?). It‚Äôs the kind that doesn‚Äôt have nuts in it. But baklava with pistachios or walnuts is also so good. Trust me on this. Go to G√ºll√ºoƒülu to have Baklava!!!  Great place for hipster shops. Just walk around and explore.  Also, if you need to develop film, there is a Fujifilm in Karak√∂y really close to G√ºll√ºoƒülu.  Apart from very important baklava, the best thing you can do to explore Karak√∂y is walk around the neighbourhood. Karak√∂y isn‚Äôt isolated, it connects to other cool neighbourhoods like Galata and Be≈üikta≈ü. You can walk to the Galata Tower from Karak√∂y. Especially at night, the neighbourhood around Galata Tower is really cool, you can also drink a lot.  Ortak√∂y: the House Cafe, shopping, shisha, kumpir  Ortak√∂y is another neighbourhood to walk around in but it isn‚Äôt hipstery like Karak√∂y or Kadƒ±k√∂y. One of my favourite restaurants in Istanbul is in Ortak√∂y, called the House Cafe. It‚Äôs a bit bougie, the food isn‚Äôt super good, and it isn‚Äôt Turkish food (just normal food lmao), but the atmosphere is AMAZING. There literally isn‚Äôt a barrier between the restaurant and the sea. So much so that some rich ass people come straight into the restaurant with their yachts lol. The restaurant isn‚Äôt so expensive though, 50-60 liras per meal, or even less.  If you don‚Äôt wanna take the bougie route, just go to one of the kumpir shops by the huge ass mosque (the Ortak√∂y mosque). Kumpir is jacket potato with lots of toppings. Use to cost like 5 liras but now it costs around 20.  Ortak√∂y has a lot of tiny shops for souvenirs and jewellery. Make sure you‚Äôre not getting ripped off, though! You shouldn‚Äôt pay more than 40 liras for anything.  Ortak√∂y is also a good place to have some shisha. Turkish shisha is a bit different than Arabic shisha I guess, but not so different. Fatih: pide  Another of my favourite restaurants is in Fatih. Fatih isn‚Äôt the most aesthetic neighbourhood but it has the BEST pide shop. Pide is like Turkish pizza(?). It‚Äôs basically dough with toppings that they bake in a huge ass oven. The restaurant is called Fatih Pide Salonu. Also not a touristic place. Get pide with ka≈üar cheese, with mince meat, and with beef bacon!! Also get ayran.  Pm me if you have any other questions!,

Hey! We‚Äôre starting a new SIG called PayWrite: Publish Your Work which hopes to become a publishing hub and network for our student community. We noticed there is a lot of content (e.g. papers, art for classes) produced at NYUAD which goes shut into the drawer or stays on a computer disk indefinitely with no purpose after the semester ends.  We aim at finding the audience for such quality work that would otherwise be paid little heed here. Members of our SIG would get access to academic journals, newspapers and other leading publishing websites with our help through our network of affiliates. By participating you risk nothing but gaining audience and associated benefits. Comment you netID under this post if you are interested üòâ,

Hey everyone! My family found this Persian kitten on the streets, beaten up and dirty. After a visit to the vet and a wash, she's been with us. She is super cuddy and playful, and has a lot of love to share! Unfortunately, she has been diagnosed with Chorona. This is a disease transmitted through saliva and feces to other cats (humans are not affected!) This means she will have to stay away from other cats and animals to ensure others don't get infected. At home, we already have 5 others cats, and so we cannot keep her for long. We want to find for her a new home. Please spread the message and tag people who may be interested or could help.

If you're a freshman taking data structures/algorithms this semester this is a message for you!!! As you may know, the CS department is basically forcing our study away to be on Junior fall, and at the moment, the operating systems class is only offered on the fall semesters. OS is a prerequisite to other classes including networks (required) and electives (computer security and I think databases, and you must take at least one CS elective in AD). This means that as of now, you would have to waste one of your classes in New York by taking OS, or be unable to take some of the electives if you opt to take it Senior fall. I talked to Godfried today and put this on his radar, and he agrees it is a waste, so if enough people are willing to take the class Sophomore Spring the CS department will consider offering the class. (By the way, you will be fresh with CSO concepts that are used for the class!) If you are interested, please comment/PM so this can move forward!,

Hi, did this mess up anyone else's schedule?,
I'm doing research at a climate modeling lab at NYUAD. The lab would like to work with students interested in climate and environmental science. We're mainly trying to create interest among students and there aren't particular objectives set beforehand so the research will be flexible. The work may involve exploring data on a particular climate change phenomenon, for instance. And if the student wants to explore their own climate change problem (understanding glacier melting in antarctica or exploring the El-Nino etc), they can work on that topic with a lot of autonomy. There will most likely be statistics and data analysis in the work. But someone with basic programming experience (file handling etc) and a good background in science and math can fit the role. This may start as a summer internship and the student may end up continuing work with the lab for capstone and beyond. Climate studies is a scientifically rich subject and what these models can do is pretty crazy. I'd think many students will like this. Please let me know if you're interested.,

STUDENT GOVT POST] A huge thank you to everyone who was able to make it to the General Assembly last night! Based on the discussion we had yesterday about the End of Year Event (which will take place on April 20th), we have narrowed down the ideas to three: 1. Gala/Dance: You know how it goes. Dress to impress and dance the night away! And if you're not into dancing, don't worry - we'll have LOTS of food and dessert to keep you occupied for the night! 2. Lounge party: Be prepared for a chill night - look nice, but fancy dresses, heels, and tuxes are NOT necessary. Sip on some mocktails and eat appetizers and other finger foods as you lounge around (possibly a pool). 3. Lounge/Gala combination: Dress for a gala or dress to lounge - it's all up to you! Dance to some good music, lounge around, both, or neither (and just go straight for the food). Give us your feedback on what you want by reacting to this post! For option #1, react with "love" <3 For option #2, react with "haha"  and for option #3, react with "wow" :O **Please react by THURSDAY MIDNIGHT (by Feb 16, 2017 at 11:59 pm)** Also leave any comments or suggestions you may have in the comments section below, and/or email me at ao1402@nyu.edu.

I require you to vote? (Is that how this works?) https://studentvote.nyu.edu  Since you are already reading let me elaborate on why I think Tami is comparably better candidate for the President: -PRIOR EXPERIENCE WITH STUGOV - we are approaching a transitional period without Vic Lindsay and with new constitution. We need somebody who was involved in Abu Dhabi StuGov and can transition to the presidential position almost without any guidance. -she GETS STUFF DONE - she does no...t only start a project but also finishes it, be it working with ResEd or class events. -she is EASY TO REACH - answers her e-mails and can make time for you/your representation when necessary. She makes time to listen to your concerns and gives advice if she can. -she is SUPPORTING YOU, NOT IDEOLOGIES - it is the student voice that matters to her, not transnational concepts. -she is not gonna be buying your votes - I am doing this because I am scared of her not winning, not because she asked. Lets be real she will not do any kind of propaganda. PM me/comment any questions you might have - I can elaborate on any of the points and why I think them applicable ONLY to Tami. See More,(
resolved) FORMS OF WRITING FOR THE SCREEN I am reaching out to those enrolled in Forms of Writing for the Screen, especially those who are not film majors. Despite registering as soon as the enrollment was opened, I did not get a place on the Forms of Writing for the Screen course with Scandar, and am currently the second on the waitlist. ... Being a decided freshman Film (Practice) major, it is mandatory that I take the course in the fall, and it is the last requirement to fulfill to study away in sophomore spring. My courses have been planned towards that goal for the past two semesters, and are jeopardized because of a single course. It should also really be taken ASAP to do better in screenwriting for other film projects. Would someone please kindly drop the course to spare a lot of worries and e-mails? Either someone enrolled, or the first person on the waitlist. I understand that this may be a lot to ask, and that I am in no way more entitled to have the spot, but if you could just PM me to have a discussion about this, I would be tremendously grateful.  Please do respond to this, and thank you in advance. See More,

WON'T BE RESOLVED / CLOSED] Can we (Student Gov, students etc.) petition to be allowed to change our flights through the airline directly instead of going through Nirvana? Ideally, Nirvana should be completely removed from this process but I know it's highly unlikely to happen. Every year when I am trying to change my flight they provide me with a ridiculous quote. Often it is twice more expensive than if I simply do it directly through the airline. Always, booking a new direct flight on your own costs a lot cheaper than changing it with Nirvana due to their ridiculous fees. NYUAD Student Government,

ISTANBUL RECOMMENDATIONS FOR SPRING BREAK  Hey guys! since half of the school population is going to Istanbul for spring break and a lot of people asked me about what to do, I thought I‚Äôd just share this on ror. (I live in Istanbul). This is so long so I kinda just put it in categories. You can message me if you have any other questions! Also, because I‚Äôm a really food oriented person, these recommendations are quite food oriented.  Make sure you get an IstanbulKart as soon as you land in Istanbul. The public transportation system is really extensive and you can go anywhere with it. Don‚Äôt forget that Google Maps will tell you which public transportation to take!! The official public transportation works with IstanbulKart (metro, metrobus, ferry, motor, buses, etc). There are also privately owned public transportation systems, like dolmu≈ü, minibus, etc. These ones can be a bit tricky to use as tourists (no official payment system/the driver 98% won‚Äôt speak English/no official stops, you just say can i get off here, etc). But the official public transportation should get you anywhere, anyways.  Istanbul basically doesn‚Äôt have wifi anywhere except some restaurants. Don‚Äôt be surprised!  If you haven‚Äôt checked yet, Turkish lira and dirham almost have the same exchange rate. So when I‚Äôm saying 120 lira, I mean like 120 dhs.  Also, I‚Äôm not gonna mention any obvious, touristy places, like the Maiden‚Äôs Tower, Hagia Sophia, Topkapƒ± Palace, etc.  √úsk√ºdar: Kuzguncuk, Meter D√∂ner, Pa≈üalimanƒ± Kafe, Fethipa≈üa Korusu, kebab  This is the Asian side, you can cross over with a ferry for couple liras. When you come to √úskudar (you‚Äôll be by the sea), just walk towards Kuzguncuk. This should be about 1, max 2 km. Kuzguncuk is super cute, reminds me of Notting Hill in London. Should have couple shops as well. For food, go to METET D√∂ner. Order d√∂ner, my favourite is pilav √ºst√º d√∂ner (this is basically meat on top of fried rice). This restaurant is quite cheap, especially according to Dhabi standards but SO delicious. When you‚Äôre walking back to central √úsk√ºdar, you should cross by Beltur Pa≈üalimani Kafe, it‚Äôs around 500 metres from Kuzguncuk. This place is run by the municipality, so it‚Äôs also relatively cheap. But the location is AMAZING. You will literally be sitting on the sea with a full fledged view of the Bosphorus. Order Turkish tea if you don‚Äôt feel like anything else. When you leave Pa≈üalimanƒ± Kafe, keep walking on the coastline and you should see the entrance to Fethipa≈üa Korusu. This is a tiny park/forest. Walk up the park and you will have an amazing view of the Bosphorus from above.  Another of my favourite places in √úsk√ºdar is this tiny kebab shop called Urfalƒ± Kasƒ±m Usta. They have the best kebab in Istanbul imo. Get Adana kebab if you like spicy food, Urfa kebab if you don‚Äôt. They‚Äôll bring it to you with your kebab, but if they don‚Äôt, ask for ezme. My fav food that no one can replicate. It‚Äôs a type of tomato/chili sauce but it‚Äôs so good. Also, if they still have it (they run out really fast), get some liver. I don‚Äôt eat it but people love it. They cut it into pieces and fry/cook it with butter. Also get ayran, the Turkish yoghurt drink. Don‚Äôt be surprised if no one speaks English, this is the least touristy place!  Kadƒ±k√∂y: Ko√ßo, rakƒ± balƒ±k, ice cream, bars My fav place in Istanbul. Again, on the Asian side and reachable by the ferry. This is a more  hipster, young area of Istanbul and it will be incredibly crowded. What you should do in Kadƒ±k√∂y is basically walk around and explore. Start walking from the street between Starbucks and Coldstone ice cream. This location description may sound weird but it‚Äôs really obvious what I mean when you‚Äôre there. You will see lots of cool shops. Go to Kadƒ±k√∂y around 5 pm, walk around a bit, eat, and go drinking. For food, go to Ko√ßo Meyhanesi. This restaurant is technically in Moda, a neighbourhood in Kadƒ±k√∂y that will take you 20 mins of walking to get to from the ferry. This place serves rakƒ± balƒ±k, which means meze (Turkish tapas), seafood and Turkish alcohol. THIS PLACE MAKES SUCH GOOD FOOD. It‚Äôs also quite expensive. I would say 130-180 liras per person depending on how much you drink. But that also means it‚Äôs just a bit more expensive than any restaurant in Abu Dhabi. I think it‚Äôs worth the money. Once you‚Äôre seated, they‚Äôll bring out a huge tray with all the tapas they have. You can choose whatever looks food. Here are my recommendations though. For cold starters: Haydari (yoghurt), Fava (bean puree? idk), Octopus salad, Hamsi (anchovy ancues), midye dolma (stuffed mussels, order one per person), lakerda (salt cured fish). For hot starters: kalamar tava (calamari), karides g√ºve√ß (shrimp casserole), tereyaƒüƒ±nda karides (shrimp fried in butter), midye tava (fried mussels). Then order Rakƒ±, 35 cl should be enough for 5-7 people. Keep in mind that two fingers of rakƒ± are mixed with a lot of water and ice. Just because you think you drink well don‚Äôt think you can drink a lot of rakƒ±!! Also, what we usually do is just order a lot of mezes, which is the stuff I listed above, and share. You can also get proper fish if you want but I don‚Äôt find it necessary after all the amazing tapas. For dessert, you can stop by Ali Usta Dondurmacƒ±sƒ±. This is a super famous ice cream shop. 5 liras per scoop, super good ice cream. Alternatively, go to Abbas waffles next door and get waffles.  After food, go to Ayƒ± Bar. This is my fav bar in Istanbul and it‚Äôs usually quite crowded. If you cant find a place, go to Fil next door. Alcohol in Istanbul is usually 15-20 lira for beer, 30-50 for cocktails and hard liquor (per glass). Karak√∂y: BAKLAVA, (hipster) shopping, developing film, Galata Tower, alcohol  Now we are in the European side. Another of my favourite neighbourhoods. In Karak√∂y, YOU HAVE TO GO TO KARAK√ñY G√úLL√úOƒûLU. This is a must to get the BEST BAKLAVA in the world. I‚Äôm not kidding. My favourite one is kaymaklƒ± baklava, which means baklava with cream(?). It‚Äôs the kind that doesn‚Äôt have nuts in it. But baklava with pistachios or walnuts is also so good. Trust me on this. Go to G√ºll√ºoƒülu to have Baklava!!!  Great place for hipster shops. Just walk around and explore.  Also, if you need to develop film, there is a Fujifilm in Karak√∂y really close to G√ºll√ºoƒülu.  Apart from very important baklava, the best thing you can do to explore Karak√∂y is walk around the neighbourhood. Karak√∂y isn‚Äôt isolated, it connects to other cool neighbourhoods like Galata and Be≈üikta≈ü. You can walk to the Galata Tower from Karak√∂y. Especially at night, the neighbourhood around Galata Tower is really cool, you can also drink a lot.  Ortak√∂y: the House Cafe, shopping, shisha, kumpir  Ortak√∂y is another neighbourhood to walk around in but it isn‚Äôt hipstery like Karak√∂y or Kadƒ±k√∂y. One of my favourite restaurants in Istanbul is in Ortak√∂y, called the House Cafe. It‚Äôs a bit bougie, the food isn‚Äôt super good, and it isn‚Äôt Turkish food (just normal food lmao), but the atmosphere is AMAZING. There literally isn‚Äôt a barrier between the restaurant and the sea. So much so that some rich ass people come straight into the restaurant with their yachts lol. The restaurant isn‚Äôt so expensive though, 50-60 liras per meal, or even less.  If you don‚Äôt wanna take the bougie route, just go to one of the kumpir shops by the huge ass mosque (the Ortak√∂y mosque). Kumpir is jacket potato with lots of toppings. Use to cost like 5 liras but now it costs around 20.  Ortak√∂y has a lot of tiny shops for souvenirs and jewellery. Make sure you‚Äôre not getting ripped off, though! You shouldn‚Äôt pay more than 40 liras for anything.  Ortak√∂y is also a good place to have some shisha. Turkish shisha is a bit different than Arabic shisha I guess, but not so different. Fatih: pide  Another of my favourite restaurants is in Fatih. Fatih isn‚Äôt the most aesthetic neighbourhood but it has the BEST pide shop. Pide is like Turkish pizza(?). It‚Äôs basically dough with toppings that they bake in a huge ass oven. The restaurant is called Fatih Pide Salonu. Also not a touristic place. Get pide with ka≈üar cheese, with mince meat, and with beef bacon!! Also get ayran.  Pm me if you have any other questions!,

Hey! We‚Äôre starting a new SIG called PayWrite: Publish Your Work which hopes to become a publishing hub and network for our student community. We noticed there is a lot of content (e.g. papers, art for classes) produced at NYUAD which goes shut into the drawer or stays on a computer disk indefinitely with no purpose after the semester ends.  We aim at finding the audience for such quality work that would otherwise be paid little heed here. Members of our SIG would get access to academic journals, newspapers and other leading publishing websites with our help through our network of affiliates. By participating you risk nothing but gaining audience and associated benefits. Comment you netID under this post if you are interested üòâ,

Hey everyone! My family found this Persian kitten on the streets, beaten up and dirty. After a visit to the vet and a wash, she's been with us. She is super cuddy and playful, and has a lot of love to share! Unfortunately, she has been diagnosed with Chorona. This is a disease transmitted through saliva and feces to other cats (humans are not affected!) This means she will have to stay away from other cats and animals to ensure others don't get infected.

If you're a freshman taking data structures/algorithms this semester this is a message for you!!! As you may know, the CS department is basically forcing our study away to be on Junior fall, and at the moment, the operating systems class is only offered on the fall semesters. OS is a prerequisite to other classes including networks (required) and electives (computer security and I think databases, and you must take at least one CS elective in AD). This means that as of now, you would have to waste one of your classes in New York by taking OS, or be unable to take some of the electives if you opt to take it Senior fall. I talked to Godfried today and put this on his radar, and he agrees it is a waste, so if enough people are willing to take the class Sophomore Spring the CS department will consider offering the class. (By the way, you will be fresh with CSO concepts that are used for the class!) If you are interested, please comment/PM so this can move forward!,

Hi, did this mess up anyone else's schedule?,
I'm doing research at a climate modeling lab at NYUAD. The lab would like to work with students interested in climate and environmental science. We're mainly trying to create interest among students and there aren't particular objectives set beforehand so the research will be flexible. The work may involve exploring data on a particular climate change phenomenon, for instance. And if the student wants to explore their own climate change problem (understanding glacier melting in antarctica or exploring the El-Nino etc), they can work on that topic with a lot of autonomy. There will most likely be statistics and data analysis in the work. But someone with basic programming experience (file handling etc) and a good background in science and math can fit the role. This may start as a summer internship and the student may end up continuing work with the lab for capstone and beyond. Climate studies is a scientifically rich subject and what these models can do is pretty crazy. I'd think many students will like this. Please let me know if you're interested.,

STUDENT GOVT POST] A huge thank you to everyone who was able to make it to the General Assembly last night! Based on the discussion we had yesterday about the End of Year Event (which will take place on April 20th), we have narrowed down the ideas to three: 1. Gala/Dance: You know how it goes. Dress to impress and dance the night away! And if you're not into dancing, don't worry - we'll have LOTS of food and dessert to keep you occupied for the night! 2. Lounge party: Be prepared for a chill night - look nice, but fancy dresses, heels, and tuxes are NOT necessary. Sip on some mocktails and eat appetizers and other finger foods as you lounge around (possibly a pool). 3. Lounge/Gala combination: Dress for a gala or dress to lounge - it's all up to you! Dance to some good music, lounge around, both, or neither (and just go straight for the food). Give us your feedback on what you want by reacting to this post! For option #1, react with "love" <3 For option #2, react with "haha"  and for option #3, react with "wow" :O **Please react by THURSDAY MIDNIGHT (by Feb 16, 2017 at 11:59 pm)** Also leave any comments or suggestions you may have in the comments section below, and/or email me at ao1402@nyu.edu. Looking forward to an amazing end of year event! ****Edit: there has been an update in option #2.,

hey alumni,  I need your help! As a senior working on my capstone, I realize how much work you put in to get a great capstone out! I also realize that there's no place for NYUAD students to showcase these amazing capstones for the next set of NYUAD students to read and enjoy!  So, I've thought of coming up with an online collection for all the capstones. I need just 3 minutes of your time to upload the capstone, and I'll take care of everything else! We've already got a few people interested, so come join the bandwagon! I hope you can help me make this a reality! Here's the link for the submission. Will literally take 3 minutes or less: https://goo.gl/forms/godgAdm7iuJkiscj1 Thank you so much!  Sincerely yours,  PWee TLDR; Take 3 minutes to upload your capstone here to get eternal fame: https://goo.gl/forms/godgAdm7iuJkiscj1,
