## Brainstorming and Class Presentation

For the final project, Farzan, Manas and I formed a group. We have decided to make a chatbot that would answer questions about NYUAD. The inspiration for this is the need that arises every year when the same set of questions are asked on the "Room of Requirements" of NYUAD about the ins and outs of the university. 

Every day dozens of questions are posted on the facebook group and we thought it would be great if we could create a bot that had the ability to learn from the Q/As. In this way, the incoming freshmen and study aways will simply be able to ask the bots all the questions and they will get their answers in no time. 

The bot would be trained on the posts and comments from RoR. RoR has a lot of training data because it is a widely used platform by the student body to ask different questions about a lot of topics. We will be able to train the model on data i.e questions asked by different students on a variety of topics. This will allow our model to deal with different questions.
